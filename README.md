# libwallet

A library that makes it easy to create crypto wallets, aims to be very high level, generic, portable and lightweight. Created to be used in the Valibre network(a substrate based network) but should support other chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum and run in all sorts of environments like native apps, embedded systems and the Web.
